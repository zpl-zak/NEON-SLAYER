# Introduction

In our game, you're supposed to leave behind a tail that other players can run into, effectively eliminating them. It is set in a futuristic abstraction of a vaporwave inspired/themed world. The game is heavily inspired by the vaporwave synth-wave retro sub-culture.

## Compilation

You can use **main.bat** to quickly access and operate the project workflow, there is also a solution file located in `code/lines.sln` you can open to compile the project.

Debug build requires **d3dx9d_42.dll** to be present in your system (Which is part of the DirectX SDK February 2010 package), you can alternatively define `NEON_FORCE_D3DX9` to force the usage of redistributable DLLs instead, this is what the Release build uses by default and is used for shipping.
